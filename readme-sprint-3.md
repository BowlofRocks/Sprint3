## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. On the terminal make sure that you have the latest version of node using: node -v
2. Install expo cli type: npm i -g expo-cli
3. To start a project type: npm init projName
4. This will take you to the template menu where you need to choose "blank"
   by pressing the needed key.
5. Check to see if the project has App.js and you're ready to go.

Instructions for using the software:

1. In the terminal type: npm start
2. I used the browser to make apps so make sure to press the w key to start that
   even if it's not an available option press it anyway and it will display an error
   with instructions on how to get it installed.
3. In order for you to get an update on your changes you will need to press the reload button
   to make sure your changes have gone through in the browswer.
