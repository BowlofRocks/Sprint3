# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name:

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

| Module                    | Selected Module |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Cloud Databases           |                 |
| Data Analysis             |                 |
| Game Framework            |                 |
| GIS Mapping               |                 |
| Mobile App                | X               |
| Networking                |                 |
| SQL Relational Databases  |                 |
| Web Apps                  |                 |
| C++                       |                 |
| Java                      |                 |
| Kotlin                    |                 |
| Erlang                    |                 |
| TypeScript                |                 |
| Rust                      |                 |
| Choose Your Own Adventure |                 |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below:

Create a Mobile App using one of the following platforms:

Android - Java or Kotlin

iOS - Swift - Note that you need a Mac using XCode for this option

React Native - Javascript - Creates Android/iOS compatible apps

Flutter/Dart - Creates Web/Android/iOS compatible apps

The app must have the following characteristics:

Have at least one screen

Be interactive with the user (e.g. responds to inputs by displaying appropriate outputs)

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc

https://www.codementor.io/projects/react-native
-This is for ideas that I could do after I have learned the basics.

2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

- Start with the react native tutorial so that I can get things started.

- Use the react native youtube tutorial

- Look at an idea and follow through with it. Then make it my own and have fun!

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

The C++ is my strongest candidate right now.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   I will chip away at it in the library every day. Times will vary depending on my life.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan?

My lack time management could get in the way of completing this project or staying at home in my office could create temptations to play games.

Mitigation Plan:

Be intentional about where my time is being alocated. Possibly plan my days out in my calendar.

Be ritualistic about the libarary, treat it as if you're going to the office.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

| Date    | Start Time | IM or TP | Description                                                  | Hours:Minutes |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
   https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner_id/1157612/uiconf_id/42438192/entry_id/1_y6agdpk6/embed/dynamic

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Are the links above public and working?                      |          |
| Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module? | Yes      |
| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    | Yes      |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   | Yes      |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

Yes, I changed it to a countdown app instead of a break reminder app. I decided to change it because I thought that it would be more fun to do but it would also be easier for me and the time that I had left for this sprint.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module | 10 Hours            |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

This sprint was much better because I took the time to understand and download the work environment. I think I just need to get some outside help to speed things up. Maybe I wil go to the tutoring lab for some possible help next time since it worked this sprint.
